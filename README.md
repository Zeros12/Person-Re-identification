| Experiment    | Rank-1        | mAP           |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Baseline      | 71.85         | 48.27         |

Baseline: trained on 90% train, cross-entropy loss, SGD, momentum = 0.9, learning rate for convolutional layers = 0.002, learning rate for fc layer  = 0.1, 30 epochs with 0.1 learning rate decay after 20th epoch

DCGAN

Some changes were made in the original code https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/dcgan/
The following changes were made: generator and discriminator recieve 128x128 input image, discriminator has 32 filters
I used generator with 128 filters in last convolutional layer and discriminator with 32 filters in first convolutional layer
